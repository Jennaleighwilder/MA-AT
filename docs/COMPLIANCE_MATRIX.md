# MAAT Compliance Matrix (v1.0)

## Bright lines (hard blocks)
- No access requests or attempts to access nonpublic juror content.
- No direct or indirect communication with jurors/prospective jurors during proceedings.
- No platform actions that violate a judge’s standing order (even if general ethics guidance would permit).

## Passive review rules
- Passive viewing of public information is treated as permitted by default rulesets.
- Some courts/judges may treat notification-triggering views as prohibited; MAAT must support a 'notification-risk block' per case.

## Juror misconduct discovery
- If research reveals apparent juror misconduct (e.g., posting about the case), MAAT flags it for counsel review and creates a reportable incident entry.

## MAAT’s product boundary
MAAT documents observable statements/events and consolidates lawful inputs.
MAAT does not diagnose, rank, or predict individual juror behavior.
